1) Construct the perpendicular h to the line p_1.
2) Plot the intersections of the line h with the line p_1 and p_2 and name these points E and F.
3) Construct the axis of the line segment EF and name it S.
4) Determine a random point S_n that lies on the line S. Construct a circle k_n centered at S_n and with radius S_n;p_1.
