1) Construct the axis of the angles of the segments p_1 and p_2 and call them S.
2) Construct the perpendicular of f to any of the given lines.
3) Find the intersection of the line f and the lines S and name them S_n1 and S_n2.
4) Construct circles k_n1 and k_n2 with centers at S_n1 and S_n2, which intersect the given lines in the same point as f.
