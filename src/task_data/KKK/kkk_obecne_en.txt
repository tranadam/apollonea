0) Three circles named *c*, *d* and *e* which are not touching nor intersecting.
1) We construct the hyperbolas *k* and *p*, whose focuses are the centers of the circles *c* and *d*.
2) We construct the hyperbolas *q* and *r*, whose focuses are the centers of the circles *c* and *e*.
3) We construct the hyperbolas *s* and *t*, whose focuses are the centers of the circles *d* and *e*.
4) We find the intersections of the hyperbolas. Those points will be the centers of the circles.
5) We find the tangent points of the final circles with the circles *c*, *d* and *e*. We do it by finding the line which passes through the intersection of the hyperbolas and the center of one of the assigned circles.
   In the intersection of this line and the assigned circles lies the tangent point of the final circle with the assigned line.
6) Construct the circles *k_1* - *k_8*.
