0. Three circles *k_1*, *k_2* and *k_3* are given. Two of them intersect.
1. We will solve the problem using dilation. Consider a solution that is tangent fron the outside with circles k1 and k2 and tangent from inside to circle k3. If this solution in the dilation is reduced to pass through the center of *S_3*, both circles *k_1* and *k_2* will increase in radius by the radius of circle *k_3*. The same is true for a solution that has inner contact with circles *k_1* and *k_2* and outer contact with circle *k_3*.
2. By dilation, we changed the kkk problem to the Bkk problem, where the point is the point *S_3* and the circles are the images of the circles *k_1* and *k_2*. We will solve this problem using circular inversion. We will use *k_3* with center *S_3* as the base circle (we can use any circle with center *S_3*, so why not use *k_3*).
3. The image of the dilated solutions are the common tangents of the circles *k_1''* and "k_2''*.
4. We display the found tangents back in the circular inversion. The obtained circles are the dilated images of the searched solutions. The centers *S_4* and *S_7* are already the centers of the searched solutions.
5. We enlarge and reduce the images of circles *k_4* and *k_7*, respectively, in the dilation by the radius of circle *k_3*. This gives the first two solutions to the problem.
6. We have found two solutions to the problem. Now we repeat the procedure to find the remaining two solutions, one of which has an outer tangent to all the given circles and the other has an inner tangent to all of them.
7. Whereas in the previous case the circles *k_1* and *k_2* were both increasing in size, now they will be decreasing in size.
8. The dilated images of circles *k_1* and *k_2* are shown in circular inversion with the main circle *k_3*.
9. Find the common tangents of the circles shown.
10. Display the found tangents back in the circular inversion. Their images are also the dilated images of the solutions we are looking for.
11. Reduce the circle *k_5 '* by dilating it by the radius of the circle *k_3*, and enlarge the circle *k_6 '*. This gives us the remaining two solutions.
12. In total, we have found four solutions to the problem.
