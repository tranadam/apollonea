0) There are circles *c*, *d* and *e*, the circle *c* lies in the circle *d*.
1) Draw hyperbolas *g* and *q*, the centres of the circles lie on them and the circles touch circles *c* and *e*.
2) Draw ellipses *p* and *t*, the centres of the circles lie on them and the circles touch circles *c* a *d*.
3) Find points of intersection of hyperbolas and ellipses.
4) Draw lines which connect the points of intersection and the centres of the assigned circles.
5) Draw the final circles with centres at the intersections of hyperbolas and ellipses, they touch the circles in their intersections with the connecting lines from step 4.
	*the individual circles apply according to the mutual position of the circles*
