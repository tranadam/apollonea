0. Three circles *k_1*, *k_2* and *k_3* are given. Two of them intersect, the third lies inside both of them.1. First, we will look for solutions that have internal contact with the circle *k_3*. We will solve the problem using dilation. We will imagine that the solution circles we are looking for are reduced so that they pass through the center of *S_3*. In order to preserve the contact between these circles and the circles *k_1* and *k_2*, the circles *k_1* and *k_2* must shrink by the radius of the circle *k_3*.2. By dilation, we have changed the kkk problem to a Bkk problem, where the point is the point *S_3* and the circles are the images of the circles *k_1* and *k_2*. We will solve this problem using circular inversion. We will use *k_3* with center *S_3* as the base circle (we can use any circle with center *S_3*, so why not use *k_3*).3. The image of the dilated solutions are the common tangents of the circles "k_1 ''" and "k_2 ''".4. We display the found tangents back in the circular inversion. The obtained circles are the dilated images of the searched solutions. The centers *S_4* and *S_7* are already the centers of the searched solutions.5. We enlarge the images of circles *k_4* and *k_7* in the dilation by the radius of circle *k_3*. This gives the first two solutions to the problem.6. We have found two solutions to the problem that have inner contact with the circle *k_3*. Now we repeat the procedure to find the solution with an outer tangent.7. While in the previous case the circles *k_1* and *k_2* were getting smaller in dilation, this time they will be getting larger.8. The dilated images of circles *k_1* and *k_2* are shown in circular inversion with the main circle *k_3*.9. Find the common tangents of the circles shown.10. Display the found tangents back in the circular inversion. Their images are also the dilated images of the solutions we are looking for.11. Reduce the circles *k_5 '* and *k_6 '* by dilating them by the radius of the circle *k_3*. Thus we have obtained both solutions with external contact to the circle *k_3*.12. In total, we found four solutions to the problem.
