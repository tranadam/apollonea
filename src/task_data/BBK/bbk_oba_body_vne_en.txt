1. Construct a circle for circular inversion. Choose the point *A* as its centre and the distance between the assigned points (the line segment *AB*) as its radius.
2. Invert the assigned circle into the newly constructed one with the help of circular inversion.
3. After constructing the new circle with c. inversion, construct its tangents which pass through the point *B*.
4. Construct two circles with the circular inversion of tangents of the circle constructed in the first step. The two circles, *k1* and *k2*, are the solution.
