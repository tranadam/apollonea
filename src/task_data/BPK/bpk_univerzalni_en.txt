1. Draw a circle for a circular inversion with a centre in point *A*.
2. Invert line *f* and circle *k* according to the circle of the circular inversion. Point *A* will be displayed indefinitely.
3. Find common tangents of displayed circles.
4. Display the tangents from step 3 over the circle of the circular inversion.
5. You have a solution!
