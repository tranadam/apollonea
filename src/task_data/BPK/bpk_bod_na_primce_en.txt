1. Draw a perpendicular to the line from the problem and point *A*. The centres of all solutions have to lie on this line.
2. Dilate point *A* by the radius of the given circle. Label the intersections with the line from step 1 with *A'* and *A''*. 
3. Draw a line segment between point *A'* and the center of the given circle and another line segment between point *A''* and the center of the given circle. The center of the solution always lies at the intersection of one of these axes and the line from step 1.
4. Draw the solution.
