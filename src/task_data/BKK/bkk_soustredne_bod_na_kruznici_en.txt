1. Construct a line intercepting points A and S
2. Find its intersection with the circle, on which doesnÂ´t lay the point A, and name them B and C
3. Find the centers of the line segments AB and AC, those are the centres of the resulting circles and shall be named S1 and S2
4. Construct the circle with its center in the point S1, which intercepts the point A and the circle with its center in the point S2, which also intercepts the point A. You should have two solutions.
