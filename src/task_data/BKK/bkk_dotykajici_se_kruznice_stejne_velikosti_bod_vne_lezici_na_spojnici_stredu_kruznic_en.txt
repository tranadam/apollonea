0) The circles "a" and "b" and the point "C" which lies on the line of their centres are given.
1) Construct a random circle with centre at point "C".
2) Perform the circular inversion of circles "a" and "b" according to this circle.
3) Construct the tangents of the resulting circles.
4) Perform the circular inversion of the tangents according to the first circle.
5) The solutions are the circles "k_1", "k_2" and "k_3".
