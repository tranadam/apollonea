We are given two touching circles and point A. Let's denote their point of tangency as T₁.
Draw a line f passing through the centers of the given circles.
Draw a line g passing through point A and the point of tangency of the circles.
Draw the bisector of segment |AT₁|.
The intersection of this bisector and line f is the center of our solution.
