0. We are given two touching circles and point *A*. Let's denote their point of tangency as *T₁*.
1. Draw a line *f* passing through the centers of the given circles.
2. Draw the bisector of segment |AT₁|.
3. The intersection of this bisector and line f is the center of our solution.
4. There is one solution.
