1) We will solve this problem using a set of points of given properties, which for a pair of a point and a circle represents a hyperbola. Draw the lines through point *C* and the centers of the given circles from the problem, i.e., points *B* and *A*. Label the intersections of the lines and circles from the problem.2) Find the midpoints between the intersections and point *C*, these points will lie on the hyperbolas we are looking for.3) Using the two foci (the center of the given circle and point *C* from the assignment) and the point lying on the search hyperbola, one of the centers from the previous step, draw hyperbolas for the two circles from the assignment and point *C*.4) The intersections of these hyperbolas are the centers of the circles we are looking for, denote them *S_1*, *S_2* and *S_3*.5) Draw the resulting circles centered at S_1*, *S_2*, and *S_3*, which pass through point *C* from the problem.6) Resulting circles of the circle, circle, point problem.
