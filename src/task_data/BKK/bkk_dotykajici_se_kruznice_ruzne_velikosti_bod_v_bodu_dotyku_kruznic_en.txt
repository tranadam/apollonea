1) Draw a line p_1 that passes through the centers of the two circles and through point A, The line p_1 is the set of points that are the centers of the circles that are solutions to the problem, the problem has infinitely many solutions
2) To illustrate, we will show the universal solution. We determine a random point S_1 that lies on the line p_1 and draw a circle k_1 with center at S_1 and radius S_1A.
3) The solution is any circle k_1 whose point lies on the line p_1.
