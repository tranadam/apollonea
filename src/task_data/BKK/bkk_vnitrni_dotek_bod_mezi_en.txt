We have two internally tangent circles and a point A lying between them.
Draw any circle e with its center at point A.
Use a circle inversion to map the circles given in the problem inside circle e.
Draw tangents to the new circles from the point 3.
Use a circle inversion to map these tangents outside circle e.
The resulting circles are the solution to the problem.
