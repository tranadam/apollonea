0. The task is three divergent lines.
1. Begin by constructing angle bisectors enclosed by the lines mentioned in the assignment. 
2. Then draw straight lines perpendicular to the assigned lines. The perpendiculars must meet with the intersections of the angle bisectors. 
3. Afterwards, construct circles with centres lying in the intersections of the anglesâ€™ segment bisectors. The point, where they touch the assigned line, should be the intersection of the assigned line and the perpendicular to the said line.
