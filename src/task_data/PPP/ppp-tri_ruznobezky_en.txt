1) We begin by constructing angle bisectors enclosed by the lines mentioned in the assignment. 

2) Then we draw straight lines perpendicular to the assigned lines. The perpendiculars must meet with the intersections of the angle bisectors. 

3) Afterwards, we construct circles with centres lying in the intersections of the anglesâ€™ segment bisectors. The point, where they touch the assigned
   line, should be the intersection of the assigned line and the perpendicular  to the said line.
