0. Three straight lines are given, two of which are parallel.
1. The centers of the circles have the same distance to all of straight lines. Such points lie on the axes of the angles given by the specified lines.
2. The centers of the circles lie at the intersections of these axes. At the same time, they must lie on the axis of the belt between the specified parallels.
3. The radius of the solution circles is given by the perpendicular distance of the centers from the specified straight lines.
4. The problem has two solutions.
