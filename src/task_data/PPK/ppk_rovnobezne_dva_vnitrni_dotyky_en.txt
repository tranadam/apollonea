1. The assignment is two parallel lines and a circle that touches both of the lines.
2. Draw axis *i* of the two parallels.
3. Draw circle *d* with the center point in the intersection of the assigned circle and the axis of the parallels *i*.
4. The intersection of the circle *d* and the axis of the parallels *i* is the center point of the first resulting circle.
5. Draw circle *k* with the center point in the intersection of the assigned circle and the axis of the parallels *i*.
6. The intersection of circle *k* and the axis of the parallels *i* is the center point of the second resulting circle.
