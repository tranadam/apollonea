We are given two intersecting lines and a circle which do not touch.
1. Trace out perpedicular lines going through the centre of the circle given and mark four points of intersection.
2. Draw four lines, which are parallel to the lines given and are going through the intersections marked in the previous step.
3. Mark four new points of intersection of these lines and draw an angle bisector between the lines given.
4. Draw two lines going trough the intersection of the lines given and intersections of L and N. Mark the points of intersection of these new lines with the circle given.
5. Draw lines crossing the centre of the circle given and one of these new points of intersection. Repeat this step for each of the four intersections.
6. Mark the points of intersection of these new lines with the angle bisector of the lines given.
7. Draw a circle given one point and centre. The centre lies on the intersections of the previoous step. The intersections of the circle of step 5 serve as a point. Every point and centre of each out of four circles lie on the same line of step 6.
