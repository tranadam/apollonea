0) Given two circles with centres *C* and *E* with outer tangent *D* and a line that has no intersection with these circles.
1) Start with a circle centered at *D* and with an arbitrary radius, e.g. |*DE*|. This will serve as the axis of the circular inversion.
2) Represent the objects from the assignment using circular inversion over the circle from the previous point. The circles shown from the assignment will be parallel lines *c'* and *e'*, and the line will appear on the circle *f'* centered at *S*.
3) Draw the tangents *m* and *l* of the circle *f'* parallel to the lines *c'* and *e'*.
4) Draw the axis of symmetry *n* of the parallel lines *c'* and *e'* and the intersection *B* of the axis *n* and the perpendicular line drawn from point *S* to the line *c'*.
5) Draw a circle centered at point *B* with radius that is the sum of the radius of the circle *f'* and the distance |*Bc'*|.
6) The intersections of this circle with the line *n* are the centers of the circles *o* and *p* with radii as |*Bc'*|.
7) Draw a circle with center at *B* and radius that is the difference of the radius of the circle *f'* and the distance |*Bc'*|.
8) The intersections of this circle with the line *n* are the centers of the circles *q* and *r* with radii as |*Bc'*|.
9) Then, we back-plot the circles *o*, *p*, *q*,*r* using circular inversion over the same circle. These circles touch all inverted objects *c'*, *e'*, *f'*.
10) Next, we back-plot the lines *m*, *l* using circular inversion over the same circle. These lines touch all inverted objects *c'*, *e'*, *f'*.
11) We have all 6 solutions to the problem.
