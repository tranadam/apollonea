2) Since the line is tangent to the outer circle c, the circles we are looking for must touch at their tangent point.
	This is found by forming a perpendicular line h to the given line g, which also passes through the centre C of the circle d.
	Let us call this tangent point H. The centres of the circles we are looking for must lie somewhere on this perpendicular.
3) Since we can view a point as a circle with radius zero, we must find a set of points that are equidistant from some focus and some controlling line.
	This is satisfied by a parabola. But since we have a circle and not a point, we have to think about what happens.
	In fact, a circle can touch another circle and a line in two ways - once on the outside, the second time on the inside.
	This gives us two different parabolas for these two cases.
	These parabolas have the control line shifted either towards or away from the focus by the radius of the circle, depending on whether we want an inside or outside touch.	
4) So, we construct two parallels to the given line f, both at a distance of the radius of the circle d and each one on the other side of the line f.
5) Construct parabolas with the focus at C and with each of the parallels respectively.
6) The intersections of the parabolas and the perpendicular line h are the centers of the resulting circles we are looking for. Let us call them S1 and S2.
7) We construct the resultant circles k1 and k2 with centers at S1 and S2 and both passing through the point H.
