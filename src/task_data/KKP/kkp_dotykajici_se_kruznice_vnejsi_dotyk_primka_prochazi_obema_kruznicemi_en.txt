0) The problem is two tangent circles and a line that passes through both circles.
1) Construct perpendiculars from the given line to the centres of the given circles.
2) Construct circles identical to the ones in the problem with the center as the foot of these perpendiculars (points *I* and *J*).
3) Draw all 4 tangents of these new circles that are parallel to the given line.
4) For each of the tangents just drawn, construct a parabola defined always by the center of the circle that the tangent touches (points *I* and *J*).
5) This will produce 6 intersections of hyperbolas that were not defined by the same point.
6) Finally, construct 6 circles centered at these points and with radii such that they touch the given line.
7) These are our resulting circles.
