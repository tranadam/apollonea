1 - 3) Since we can view a point as a circle with radius zero, we must find a set of points that are equidistant from some focus and some control line.
	This is satisfied by a parabola. But since we have a circle and not a point, we have to think about what happens.
	In fact, a circle can touch another circle and a line in two ways - once on the outside, the second time on the inside.
	This gives us two different parabolas for these two cases.
	These parabolas have the control line shifted either towards or away from the focus by the radius of the circle, depending on whether we want an inside or outside touch.
4) Since we have two circles, we therefore construct four parallels to the given line f, two at a distance of the radius of the circle d and each one on the other side of the line f, and two at a distance of the radius of the circle c and each one on the other side of the line f.
5 - 6) Construct all four parabolas. Two with a focus at point C, two with a focus at point A, each with a different one of the parallel lines as the controlling line.
7) The intersections of the parabolas are the centres of the resulting circles we are looking for. Let us call them S1, S2, S3 and S4.
8 - 9) The tangent points of the resultant circles are the intersections of the circle d and the union of the centers of C and the found centers respectively. Let us call them T1, T2, T3 and T4.
10) Construct the resultant circles k1, k2, k3 and k4 with centers at S1, S2, S3 and S4 and intersecting points T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively.
