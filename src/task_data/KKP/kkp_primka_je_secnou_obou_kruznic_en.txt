1) Using dilatation, we shrink one circle into a point, the second one by the radius of the smaller circle. We move the assigned line by distance equal to the radius of the smaller circle.
2) We draw a circle p passing through the circle c with a center in the point C (center of one of the assigned circles). We wil use this circle for circular inversion.
3) We display the line moved with dilatation and the circle shrinked with dilatation using circular inversion
4) We find the common tangent of the both newly formed circles.
5) We display the tangents on the circles.
6) We find the centers of the newly formed circles, the solutions will be concentric with them.
7) We enlarge the circles by the radius of the smaller assigned circle.
8) Those circles are the solutions to this problem.
