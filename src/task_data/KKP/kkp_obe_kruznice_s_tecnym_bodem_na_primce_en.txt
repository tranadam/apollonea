1) construct lines h and g perpendicular to the given line passing through the centers of both circles
2) construct circles k and e with centers at the intersections of the perpendiculars and the given line and radii to the centers of the given circles
3) construct lines perpendicular to line h passing through points M and N, and construct lines perpendicular to line g passing through points L and K
4) construct four parabolas p, q, r, and s with vertices at points N, L, I, and H, the intersection of parabolas r and p is one of the centers of the circle is the solution of the problem, and the other intersection point is the point T, which is also the center of a circle that is the solution of the problem
5) construct line b that is perpendicular to line f passing through S and line t perpendicular to line f passing through point T
6) construct circles c and f with radii from the given centers to the intersection of the perpendicular with line f, which are the solution to the problem
7) clean the space of auxiliary constructions
8) construct circles with centers at the tangent points, we will display them in a circular inversion.
9) display circle d in a circular inversion
10) display both circles in a circular inversion, each to the circle which they do not intersect
11) find tangents of the images of the circles parallel to line f
12) display the resulting circles and lines back in a circular inversion, the circles are the solution to the problem
