1. Draw axis *i* of the two parallels.
2. Draw circle *d* with the center point in the intersection of the assigned circle and the axis of the parallels *i*.
3. The intersection of the circle *d* and the axis of the parallels *i* is the center point of the first resulting circle.
4. Draw circle *k* with the center point in the intersection of the assigned circle and the axis of the parallels *i*.
5. The intersection of circle *k* and the axis of the parallels *i* is the center point of the second resulting circle.
