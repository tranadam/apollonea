Two parallel lines and a circle, out of which one line touches and the other one intersects the circle.

1. Construct a line perpendicular to the lines that pass through the centre of the given circle.
2. Find the center of the line segment formed by the two intersections with the given lines. Name this point S_1, it is the center of one of the solutions.
3. Draw a parallel line with the given lines that passes through the point S_1.
4. Draw a circle with the radius of the given line + the distance of the point S_1 and one of the intersections. 
5. The intersections of this circle with parallel are the next two solutions, S_2 and S_3.
6. We only draw the final circles from the centers S_1, S_2, S_3 with radius distance S_1 and one of the intersections.
