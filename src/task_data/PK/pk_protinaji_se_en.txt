1) Draw a perpendicular to the given line passing through the centre S of the given circle
2) Construct a circle centered at the intersection of the given line and its perpendicular
3) Construct parallel lines with the given line passing through the intersections of the circle we constructed and the perpendicular to the given line
4) Construct two parabolas with a focus at point S, the control lines being the parallel lines we constructed to the given line
