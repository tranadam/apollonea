1) Construct the bisector of the angle which is defined by the two lines from the assignment. Name this angle bisector *i*. On this bisector must lie the centers of the circles (these circles are the solution to the assignment).
2) Construct a circle and name it *c*. Tangents of circle *c* are the lines from the assignment, with the center of circle *c* on the angle bisector *i*. We then use circle *c* as a pattern for homogenous dilation.
3) Construct a line which passes through the intersection of the lines from the assignment and the point *A* from the assignment. Name this line *k*. This will give us the patterns of the touchpoints for the homogenous dilation.
4) Construct two lines which pass through the center of circle *c* and the intersections of circle *c* with line *k*.
5) Construct the parallels to both of the lines constructed in step 4 so that they pass through point *A*. Thus we have projected these two lines through homogenous dilation and therefore we can find the centers of the circles that are the solution to the assignment.
6) Intersections of the angle bisector *i* and the projected lines from step 5 are the centers of the final circles.
7) Construct the circles with the found centers, passing through the point *A*.
