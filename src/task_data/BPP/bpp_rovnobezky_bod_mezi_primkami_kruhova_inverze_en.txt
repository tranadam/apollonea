0. Given two parallel lines and a point lying between them.
1. We will solve the problem using circle inversion. First, we choose a reference circle, its center is the entered point, which will be displayed to infinity. This will make the solution circles appear as straight lines.
2. In the circle inversion, we display the specified straight lines. They are displayed as a circle passing through the specified point.
3. We construct the common tangents of both circles. These are images of solutions. There is a third common tangent passing through the specified point, but we are not interested in it.
4. We display the common tangents in a circle inversion, thereby obtaining both solutions.
5. The problem has two solutions.
