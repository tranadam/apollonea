1. Draw a line *h* perpendicular to the assigned line *p_1* passing through point *A*. That gives you the centers of circles, that pass through point *A* and of which the line *p_1* is their tangential.
2. Draw axes of the angles formed by the assigned lines. That gives you the centres of circles, that have the assigned lines as tangentials.
3. The intersection of the axes and line *h* are centers of circles that are the solution.
4. Construct the solution.
